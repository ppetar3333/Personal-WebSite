								<h2 class="major pulse">About</h2>
								<p>Hi there 👋,  </p>
								<p>I'm Petar from Serbia, and i do for most of my time Front End Development. I really enjoy learning new languages. Beside Front End Development I also do Software Development in Java and C# (.NET).</p>
								<p>From the moment I produced “Hello World!” in the console of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of software development. But software development has never been “just a job” for me, it’s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills in creating high-quality software. What started with a simple “Hello World!” has become a full-fledged passion that only gets more exciting as the days and months go by. </p>
